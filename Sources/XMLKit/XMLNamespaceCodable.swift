import Foundation

/// A protocol indicating a type can be encoded or decoded in an XML namespace.
///
/// Types conforming to `XMLNamespaceCodable` allow `XMLEncoder` and `XMLDecoder`
/// to handle properties tied to specific XML namespaces. This ensures elements
/// belonging to namespaces are encoded or decoded into keyed structures, even
/// if the XML elements exist at the same depth.
///
/// ### Example
/// For an XML structure with elements in different namespaces:
///
/// ```xml
/// <root>
///     <dc:title>Sample Title</dc:title>
///     <dc:creator>Author</dc:creator>
///     <media:thumbnail>image.jpg</media:thumbnail>
/// </root>
/// ```
///
/// A struct conforming to `XMLNamespaceCodable` can represent the data:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Document: Codable {
///     struct DublinCore: Codable, XMLNamespaceCodable {
///         let title: String
///         let creator: String
///
///         private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
///             case title = "dc:title"
///             case creator = "dc:creator"
///         }
///     }
///
///     struct Media: Codable, XMLNamespaceCodable {
///         let thumbnail: String
///
///         private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
///             case thumbnail = "media:thumbnail"
///         }
///     }
///
///     let dublinCore: DublinCore
///     let media: Media
///
///     private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
///         case dublinCore = "dc"
///         case media = "media"
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Using `XMLEncoder` or `XMLDecoder`, the `dublinCore` and `media` properties will map
/// to their respective namespaces (`dc:` and `media:`) while maintaining their
/// association within the keyed structure of `Document`.
///
/// The `XMLNamespaceCodable` protocol is optional and primarily intended for models where
/// elements are grouped under specific namespaces. It is useful for extensive
/// models that require clear separation and organization of elements based on
/// their namespaces. For simpler use cases, direct encoding and decoding without
/// this protocol might suffice.
public protocol XMLNamespaceCodable {}
